This is the source code for the document “Best Practices for Reporting MCMC
Analyses,“ which suggests how Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses should
be reported in the refereed academic literature so that others can understand
what was done and reproduce it if needed.

The nicely-formatted document itself lives at
<http://pkgw.github.io/mcmc-reporting/>.
